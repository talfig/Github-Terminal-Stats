## 📊 What is Github-Terminal-Stats?

**Github-Terminal-Stats** is a dynamic and automated way to display your GitHub statistics in a stylish terminal-like format! Every day, the stats are updated automatically via GitHub Actions, which fetch data like:

- 🌟 Total Stars
- 🍴 Forks
- 💾 Commits (from your own contributions)
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Followers
- 🔄 Pull Requests
- ❓ Issues
- 📁 Repositories
- 📝 Gists
- ⏳ Uptime (days since your earliest repository)

All this data is neatly displayed in a retro terminal style, keeping your profile interactive and informative. 

## 🛠️ How it Works

This repository includes a Python script that gathers stats from the GitHub API and updates the **SVG file** with fresh numbers every day. The GitHub Actions workflow is scheduled to run daily, ensuring your stats are always current. 

Feel free to fork the project, customize it, or even create your own cool terminal-style badges! 💻
